			          		We started our business in April 2015 in a very simple way: starting our Instagram account. We eventually registered our business as an LLC in September 2015. We started because we traveled to dozens of countries while living in England and ended up seeking out great coffee shops everywhere we went, not just because we are coffee lovers, but because we love everything that a coffee shop can be. We played chess in a tiny basement bookstore/coffee shop in Bergen, Norway. We made a great connection with a small record/coffee shop owner in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We had our Eureka moment in a shop in Bath, UK where we both finally tasted all those flavors that bags of coffee promise but never really seem to deliver. We became regulars at the smallest cafe weâ€™ve ever seen in Paris, France while we lived there for three weeks in April. The barista there was the epitome of cool, the coffee was great, and everyone talked to everyone else the entire time. Ross is obsessed with the technical side of always improving the quality of the coffee, and Meg is obsessed with the way in which coffee shops become hubs of community activity and people making connections.
